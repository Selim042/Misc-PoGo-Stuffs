  {"name":"The Team GO Rocket Leaders have disrupted Pokemon habitats!","description":"The movement of the Team GO Rocket Leaders seems to have disrupted Pokemon habitats, and certain Pokemon have apparently become more common! We have yet to understand why these Pokemon in particular are suddenly appearing more frequently. Perhaps they have some special significance wherever Team GO Rocket came from?\n\nIn addition, we have made the following discoveries:\n- Team GO Rocket has started using the following Shadow Pokemon: Sandshrew, Bellsprout, Magnemite, Porygon, and Wobbuffet.\n- The Team GO Rocket Leaders seem to be the only Team GO Rocket members who now have access to the following Shadow Pokemon: Meowth, Scyther, and Sneasel! The only question is...which leader has which Pokemon?\n\nOur information is incomplete, and investigations into this phenomenon are ongoing, so be on the lookout for other surprises!
